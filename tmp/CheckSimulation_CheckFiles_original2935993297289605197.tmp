/**
 * Class PresentationDirection is a printing attribute class, an enumeration,
 * that is used in conjunction with the {@link  NumberUp NumberUp} attribute to
 * indicate the layout of multiple print-stream pages to impose upon a
 * single side of an instance of a selected medium.
 * This is useful to mirror the text layout conventions of different scripts.
 * For example, English is "toright-tobottom", Hebrew is "toleft-tobottom"
 *  and Japanese is usually "tobottom-toleft".
 * <P>
 * <B>IPP Compatibility:</B>  This attribute is not an IPP 1.1
 * attribute; it is an attribute in the Production Printing Extension
 * (<a href="ftp://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/standards/pwg5100.3.pdf">PDF</a>)
 * of IPP 1.1.  The category name returned by
 * <CODE>getName()</CODE> is the IPP attribute name.  The enumeration's
 * integer value is the IPP enum value.  The <code>toString()</code> method
 * returns the IPP string representation of the attribute value.
 * <P>
