/**
 * Class Fidelity is a printing attribute class, an enumeration,
 * that indicates whether total fidelity to client supplied print request
 * attributes is required.
 * If FIDELITY_TRUE is specified and a service cannot print the job exactly
 * as specified it must reject the job.
 * If FIDELITY_FALSE is specified a reasonable attempt to print the job is
 * acceptable. If not supplied the default is FIDELITY_FALSE.
 *
 * <P>
 * <B>IPP Compatibility:</B> The IPP boolean value is "true" for FIDELITY_TRUE
 * and "false" for FIDELITY_FALSE. The category name returned by
 * <CODE>getName()</CODE> is the IPP attribute name.  The enumeration's
 * integer value is the IPP enum value.  The <code>toString()</code> method
 * returns the IPP string representation of the attribute value.
 * See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2911.txt">RFC 2911</a> Section 15.1 for
 * a fuller description of the IPP fidelity attribute.
